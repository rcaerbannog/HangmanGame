# HangmanGame

My ISP for my first high school computer science course (ICS2O) that I took in grade 10. Literally hangman--guess the word!

This runs on the Turing language, a simple, education-focused language which was used in Ontario high schools for the ICS2O courses to introduce new students to programming and graphics. (Classes after ours started with Processing.) I've included the last version of Turing so that the program can be run.
